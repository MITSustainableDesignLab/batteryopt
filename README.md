batteryopt is a battery operation optimization tool developed by Jakub Szcze≈õniak and implemented by Samuel Letellier-Duchesne. The objective is to minimize the annual electricity costs of a battery-integrated PV system using a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). The algorithm is implemented using the [pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) library opening up the model to a large array of solvers (e.g.: Gurobi, GLPK, etc.).
